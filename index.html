        Sai Ashish
        </h1>
          <p>Humble. Humorous. Doped. Elevated. Wasted. These are the adjectives you will associate Sai Ashish
‘Kalo’ with, the minute you see him. A zealous gamer and a shopping freak-‘Ashu’ or “Toto” as he is fondly
called by his mates, is quite temperamental and never has anyone dared to get on his bad side. A die
hard cricketer who never misses a single match, add to this his love for music and food he is the perfect
company for vacation trip or a road trip. This chilled-out guy also relishes his occasional high-fives with
almighty Bob Marley. All the stilettoes and weed jokes aside, Kalo is definitely a very humble, kind hearted
and a very helpful guy. There are times when you'll be busy figuring out your life, and then you have
this guy to make you stop doing that, and just learn to live it to the fullest. He's the little sparkle in the
plain water, which is meant to shine under the moonlight. The transformation from being a lazybones in
the first year to one of the most active boy in the institute, Kalo has evolved as a very strong, carefree
and an independent personality. He has handled himself through thick and thin and has come out as an
extremely mature individual. With all the love he has shared, we wish him the best of luck for his future
endeavours.</p>

        Satyabrata Mohapatra
        </h1>
          <p>Famous in the institute as Chinu, Chua, or JD (Jajpur Don), Satyabrata Mohapatra loves to act like a Mobboss,
but on the inside he is just a kid. One of the most ‘Senti’ guy in the branch, Chinu is a living proof
of all the stereotypes about Jajpur District. This guy is the true definition of GMAT, come exams you
can find him roaming hall to hall taking personal coaching from the toppers. His attraction for shoes is
even greater than girls, and buys one or two pairs every month. But these shoes gather dust in his room,
while he roams around in Woodland (To look tall, LOL). He is fond of Fast- food, and his craze for Chicken
Garlic and Biryani can’t be explained in words, and he becomes Joey when it comes to food. Being a
secret romantic, he has spent some considerable time in the wonderland of love in the last part of his
B.Tech career. Always high on confidence, this guy looks at life with an uber-positive attitude. Narcissistic
to the core, he thinks he is the Anuvab Mohanty of NITR. All jokes aside, he is a very humble guy with
just a teeny tiny problem of having an ego the size of Jupiter. With his determined mindset, and positive
attitude, he is someone to watch out for in the future./p>

        Buddhadev Rath 
        </h1>
          <p>With a heavy-weight body and an appearance of a Sumo wrestler, one may think of him as a bully on
the very first look, but in reality, he stands as the antonym of all these. In fact, he is like a “Panda” who
is adored by everybody. Popularly known as “Dudu”, “Moto-B, Hello MOTO” and “Rikishi” among his
friends, Buddhadev Rath is a suave, funny and a witty guy. He houses great amount of knowledge in
the field of history, polity besides the civil engineering stuffs in his huge body. He is an ardent lover of
WWE. An excellent orator and having a great love for practical studies rather than the traditional bookish
knowledge, he is a great person to have aside in both good and hard times. Even, he has been teased by
one of the professors for his weight as, “L&T join karo, weigth lose hoga”. Mr. Rath has gone from being
a very obedient and a student cautious about grades in the first year to a care-free and one of the most
chilled out person of the branch. Wishing him all the best for the future.</p>

          <p>Tanmaya Kumar Patra aka Tommy is an extremely indolent person hailing from the mining city of Jajpur.
An introvert, he spends most of his time with his closest of peers. Funny, but he is usually silent in large
groups. He is dependable and is always the center of many jokes among his friends. Takes things lightly,
but gets serious when it comes to his life situations. His friends wear an extra pair of garments to save
themselves from the pain of his epic GPL sessions. His world revolves around YouTube for information
and he rarely chooses other search engines. He is famous as CEO of Alia Boys, a gang cum organization
formed by his friends, where they sit together doing nothing but share their satirical wisdom. A fake
touter, he says he is one of the best boxers and can defeat the UFC champion, Rounda Rousey. This guy
can take up any hypothetical concept and can convince you to believe his own version of the story. He
bets on various things but never fulfils the conditions of the bet after losing it. When you need that extra
player to complete your team, Tommy is your best bet in various games.</p>

Rakesh Kumar Nayak aka Rocky is one of the toppers of the mining department. He is a pro in Counter
Strike, Rummy and hailing everyone in the department. He can spend hours discussing a particular topic
and loves the debating sessions. His phone and he are so bonded that he cared for his phone more than
his own life during one of his auto toppling incident. He possesses a good skill set but fails to utilize it
due to his habit of laziness. Having ancestral bonds with Coal India, this guy from Talcher has extreme
grasping powers and good memory. He is one of the active members of his own group of friends who call
themselves The Alia Boys. His PPT has become one of the relics of the mining department since this guy
presented on the same topic as part of assignments in different subjects. This bigmouth has got a pretty
loud voice, even his whispers can disturb a nerd sitting in the first bench. Despite having dreams to work
in his home town, he bagged a prestigious job in Vedanta.</p>

for everything and takes a great pleasure in presenting them. A kind and helpful guy who finds it difficult
to say no to anybody who approaches him, takes immense pleasure in helping out his friends both
academically and financially. Sometimes he falls prey to his own generosity because of his simplicity
and his laziness in giving reminders to return his belongings. Famous for his life hacks and economically
favorable solutions among his group “Alia Boys”, you will be lucky to have his friendship in your life. Apart
from his slender and slim physique, this emerging self-proclaimed Casanova, from his school days, “as
he says it”, owes his popularity among girls to his brotherly & comforting attitude towards them. With a
vision, he always dreams of changing the existing system in the society, but ends up spending most of his
time on WhatsApp having romantic conversations and playing games. A strong believer of crash course,
he will be the first one in the horde to push his all-in-one rough note for the last minute notes. He still
manages to get a decent CGPA by studying those notes with great difficulty the night before exams.</p>

          <p>Dibya aka Dabua, Pawanputra and Samal jr., is the most bindaas guy one can ever meet in not just nit
Rourkela, but also in their life. This guy creates his own rules and lives life according to his ideals. This
future con artist has his way with words and can trick anyone into believing him and he uses this talent
fully in getting medical leaves from the institute dispensary. Fortunate are the ones who see him in class,
for he prefers getting a leave and bunking classes to enduring lectures. This guy has the academic rule
book at the tip of his tongue and is brilliant at finding loopholes in it to abstain from lectures. However
lazy people might judge him to be, Dibya is very passionate about things he loves. He is the one guy who
doesn’t even know where the box is, when you ask him for ideas, which makes him the start-up stud
among his friends. The only things he sacrifices his sleep for are cricket and movies. His super-long movie
bucket-list leaves out no movie from any language or time or the IMDB rating. A caring person to his
friends, the star of all parties, Dibya is one person whom everyone should have in their life.</p>

          <p>Roshan Tarai also known as NANI, is the most cheerful guy of the branch. He always wear a smile on his
face that is quite infectious (It will literally make you grin). No one has ever seen his sad or angry face,
many tried to rattle him, but failed utterly. Hailing from Koraput, Odisha this guy will never refuse to help
you and will always stand by your side. He was a frail guy in the fresher years and worked really hard to get
the perfect manly body, but ended up with a sexy rear and an hourglass figure. This Vin Diesel aficionado,
has watched Fast and Furious series nearly a million times (And I’m not kidding). Dashing with a typical
walking style, Nani dreams of a body like Vin Diesel and the personality of Dominic Toretto. Known for
his ridiculous fidgeting and typical jargon that makes everyone roll with laughter, but loved by all, Nani is
a friend who will talk with you, walk with you, listen to you patiently, and always reassures you with his
three magical words ’Haan Ma Chaliba!’(Meaning- Everything will be Fine). Even though his friends pester
him a lot and sometimes make him crazy, he’s still the favorite of many because of his uniqueness that he
has created a lasting impression in everyone's mind and heart. We wish him all the luck for future.</p>

          <p>There are two ways to achieve anything - go hard or go smart. Mukti Ranjan Harichandan aka (Mendax,
Hadi, hari) believes in the latter. This lazy ass with an amazingly high IQ has always found smart ways to
get his job done. Unfailingly, he would always be the last person to submit the assignment or write the
lab record. Facing grade backs in the first month itself is a feat very few could achieve (owing to the fact
that he never sleeps at night). Active on DC++ with the nick mend@x, he has a vast collection of rock
albums, blues and trippy music. Talk about Hollywood movies and he can discuss with you for hours. One
of the most intelligent guys of the batch, he’s as intelligent as he’s lazy is. It has always been one night
studies for him to manage decent grades. His motto is “ Go Green, Go Herbal ” (pun intended) with his
idols being Bob Marley and the likes. He can give you a serious trippy session with his out of box ideas
about universe and life after he is high. Trustworthy, kind and an honourable friend, you can be assured
he’s got your back no matter how deep you’re screwed</p>
